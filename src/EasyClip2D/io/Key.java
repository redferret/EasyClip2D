/**
 * The key object is used for user input. The class is abstract
 * and must be implemented. There are several methods in which
 * to create a key object. The most useful and common way is
 * to use the class as a template for many instances of the same
 * object rather than creating an UpKey, DownKey, etc. classes.
 * Instead MyKey would be a good use for this. Also the KeyController
 * class keeps track of the particular KeyEvent for a key.
